        <div class="mySlides">
          <p>Is Seating Random For The Ceremony or Dinner event?</p>
          <p class="answer">Nope! For the ceremony, sit wherever you please! However, we will be carefully arranging tables so our guests are sat with those they know(or their plus one or partner). We know weddings are a mixing pot of guests who many not know one another, and we want to ease any anxieties for guests who may be a bit more introverted. Hopefully this can put some of you at ease!.</p>

        <div class="mySlides">
          <p>What Do I Do If I'm Late For The Ceremony?</p>
          <p class="answer">If you are late for the ceremony, that is totally fine! The ceremony will PROMPTLY start at 4pm so we recomment you shoot for a 3:30-3:45 arrival so you have time to mingle, find a seat, and grab a fan and a program.</p>

          <p>Since There Will Be Alcohol, What Do We Do About Driving? </p>
          <p class="answer">We DO NOT want anyone drinking and driving. The Chateaux at Fox Meadows agrees. As such, they allow guests to leave their vehicles overnight at the venue and pick them up the following morning by (blank). We encourage Uber, Lyfts or Taxis. Additionally if you stay in the nearby hotel Fairfield by Marriot, they do have a shuttle bus that will pick up guests and take them to and from the wedding venue. </p>
